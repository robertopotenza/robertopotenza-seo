### Idea 1: "The Modern Craftsman" (Selected Approach)
**Design Movement:** Modern Industrial Minimalism / Quiet Luxury
**Core Principles:**
1. **Precision & Clarity:** Every element has a purpose, reflecting Roberto's operational excellence.
2. **Human-Centric Engineering:** Technology serves people, mirroring Ken Endelman's philosophy.
3. **Transparency & Depth:** Clean surfaces that reveal depth upon interaction, symbolizing the "system behind the craft."
4. **Sustainable Future:** Earth tones mixed with industrial precision to highlight sustainability.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Primary:** Dark Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - Represents stability, authority, and the "black box" of operations made visible.
- **Secondary:** Light Gray (#F5F5F5) - The canvas of potential and clean manufacturing floors.
- **Accent:** Soft Teal (#2E8C9E) - A nod to Balanced Body's brand but muted for executive sophistication.
- **Warmth:** Wood/Beige tones (#D8C4A5) - Used in imagery to connect with the wooden reformers and craftsmanship.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Asymmetric Balance:** Avoids rigid center alignment. Uses a 60/40 split often found in architectural diagrams.
- **Modular Grid:** Content is organized in "modules" or "cards" that feel like components of a larger machine.
- **Generous Whitespace:** Reflects the "calm" leadership style Roberto brings.

**Signature Elements:**
1. **"The Blueprint" Lines:** Subtle 1px lines that guide the eye, representing process flow and engineering drawings.
2. **Split-Screen Hero:** One side professional portrait/intro, other side abstract macro shot of a reformer or industrial texture.
3. **Data Visualization as Art:** KPIs (74% OEE, $58M Expansion) presented as elegant, minimal infographics, not just numbers.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Smooth Flow:** Scrolling feels like a well-oiled machine.
- **Deliberate Reveals:** Content fades in with a slight upward motion, symbolizing growth and improvement.
- **Tactile Hover:** Buttons and cards have a subtle lift or shadow deepen, mimicking the physical feedback of quality equipment.

**Animation:**
- **Entrance:** Staggered fade-ins for text and images.
- **Scroll:** Parallax effect on background textures (wood grain, metal).
- **Micro:** Icons draw themselves (SVG path animation) to emphasize "building" and "engineering."

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** *Helvetica Neue* (Bold/Light mix) - Classic, neutral, authoritative.
- **Body:** *Proxima Nova* or *Inter* - Highly readable, modern, functional.
- **Hierarchy:** Large, bold H1s contrasted with uppercase, tracked-out labels (e.g., "OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE").

### Idea 2: "The Strategic Visionary"
**Design Movement:** Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
**Core Principles:**
1. **Objective Photography:** Large, unmanipulated images of factories and products.
2. **Grid Systems:** Rigid, mathematical grids to show order and logic.
3. **Typography as Image:** Large type used as a primary visual element.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Primary:** Black & White - Stark, high contrast.
- **Accent:** International Orange - Highlighting safety, action, and industrial energy.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Strict Grid:** 12-column grid visible in alignment.
- **Typographic Scale:** Massive headings that span the full width.

**Signature Elements:**
1. **Big Type:** "74% OEE" takes up half the screen.
2. **Monochrome Images:** Black and white photos with color overlays on hover.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Snap Scroll:** Sections snap into place, emphasizing distinct strategic points.
- **Hover Reveals:** Text appears over images.

**Animation:**
- **Slide:** Elements slide in from cardinal directions.
- **Typewriter:** Text appears character by character.

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** *Akzidenz-Grotesk* or *Roboto* - Industrial, objective.
- **Body:** *Roboto Mono* - Technical, code-like.

### Idea 3: "The Organic Flow"
**Design Movement:** Biophilic Design / Soft Modernism
**Core Principles:**
1. **Nature & Machine:** Blending organic shapes with mechanical precision.
2. **Fluidity:** Continuous movement, no hard stops.
3. **Wellness:** Reflecting the end-user benefit of Pilates.

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Primary:** Sage Green & Earth Tones.
- **Accent:** Soft Gold.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- **Curved Lines:** Section dividers are waves or curves.
- **Overlapping Elements:** Images and text overlap to create depth.

**Signature Elements:**
1. **Organic Shapes:** Blobs and curves behind images.
2. **Soft Focus:** Images have soft edges.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- **Parallax:** extensive use of parallax.
- **Smooth Scroll:** Inertia scrolling.

**Animation:**
- **Float:** Elements gently float.
- **Morph:** Shapes change form.

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** *Playfair Display* - Elegant, editorial.
- **Body:** *Lato* - Humanist sans-serif.
